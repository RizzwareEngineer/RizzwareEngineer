# About Me

**Applying my experience in ML/AI Research and Software Engineering to develop backend infrastructure within:**
- Generative AI
- Large Language Models
- ML Infrastructure
- Data Infrastructure
- Distributed Systems

> [!CAUTION]
> I'm an avid frontend and mobile development hater. ðŸ¤— 

# Projects
**I also develop applications exploring novel use cases of Generative AI, including:**

## [PixeLana](https://github.com/RizzwareEngineer/PixeLana) 
A multiplayer drawing game where players alternate submitting prompts and using Stable Diffusion to generate the best images fitting those prompts; winners will have their creations minted on the Solana Blockchain!

_Awarded "1st Place Best Overall" at HackIllinois 2024 (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)._

> PyTorch, TypeScript, Rust, Stable Diffusion, Solana Blockchain

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository is the final version of PixeLana submitted to [HackIllinois 2024](https://hackillinois-2024.devpost.com/). PixeLana will be revamped for [Renaissance](https://www.colosseum.org/renaissance), a global online hackathon hosted by the Solana Foundation! Our production repository for Renaissance is currently private. We will publicize our work some time on or after March 11, 2024 to protect ourselves of plagiarism. 

## [Wonderland](https://github.com/RizzwareEngineer/wonderland)
A collaborative Stable Diffusion canvas where multiple users can simultaneously generate and modify the same images through text prompts. 

_Awarded "1st Place Best Overall" and "Best in Programmatic Art" at Uncommon Hacks 2023 (University of Chicago)._

> PyTorch, TypeScript, Socket.IO, Stable Diffusion

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository is the final version of Wonderland submitted to [Uncommon Hacks 2023](https://github.com/RizzwareEngineer/wonderland). I plan to either continue development of Wonderland directly  or recycle it as the base of more fleshed-out version.
